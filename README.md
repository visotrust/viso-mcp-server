# VISO TRUST MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating VISO TRUST API capabilities with AI assistants.

## Requirements

- Java 21+
- Gradle
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
- MCP Inspector (optional for testing)

## Configuration

### VISO TRUST API Configuration

The following properties can be configured for the VISO TRUST API:

- `visotrust.api.base-url`: The base URL for the VISO TRUST API (default: http://localhost:8080)
- `visotrust.api.token`: Your API token from the VISO TRUST platform (required)
- `visotrust.api.timeout`: API request timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)
- `visotrust.api.connect-timeout`: API connection timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)

For information on how to generate an API token for the `visotrust.api.token` environment variable, see the [VISO TRUST support documentation](https://support.visotrust.com/article/olo26aapun-generateaccesstoken).

### Manual Setup with VS Code
Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON).
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "viso_baseurl",
        "description": "VISO TRUST API Base URL",
        "default": "https://app.visotrust.com"
      },
      {
        "type": "promptString",
        "id": "viso_token",
        "description": "VISO TRUST API Token",
        "password": true
      }
    ],
    "servers": {
      "viso-mcp": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "-e",
          "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN",
          "-e",
          "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL",
          "visotrustai/viso-mcp-server:latest"
        ],
        "env": {
          "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL": "${input:viso_baseurl}",
          "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN": "${input:viso_token}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.
```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "viso_baseurl",
      "description": "VISO TRUST API Base URL",
      "default": "https://app.visotrust.com"
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "viso_token",
      "description": "VISO TRUST API Token",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "viso-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL",
        "visotrustai/viso-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VISOTRUST_API_BASEURL": "${input:viso_baseurl}",
        "VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN": "${input:viso_token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üíª Development

### Docker Setup

#### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t viso-mcp-server .
```

#### Run Docker Container
```bash
docker run -i --rm -e VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token> viso-mcp-server
```

### Debugging

#### Install MCP Inspector
```bash
npm -g install @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

#### Run MCP Inspector for Testing

1. Build MCP Server Jar File
```bash
./gradlew bootJar
```

2. Run MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
    -e JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=\*:5005 \
    -e VISOTRUST_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token> \
    java -jar build/libs/viso-mcp-server-<version>.jar \
    --port 8080 --host localhost
```

Replace `<version>` with the current version of the project (e.g., `1.0.0` or the version from the latest release).

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow includes the following jobs:

#### Lint

Checks code formatting using Spotless:
```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

#### Build

Builds the application and creates a JAR file:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

#### Publish

When a new release is created:
1. Updates the project version in build.gradle to match the release tag
2. Uploads the JAR file to the GitHub release with the version from the release tag
3. Builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub with tags:
   - `latest`
   - The release tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

##### Required Secrets for Publishing

To enable Docker Hub publishing, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token

## Code Formatting

This project uses [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) with Google Java Format for code formatting. A pre-commit hook is automatically set up to ensure consistent code style.

### Setup

After cloning the repository, the pre-commit hook will be automatically set up when you run any Gradle command.

### Manual Formatting

To manually format all files:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

To check if files are formatted correctly:

```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
```

If the pre-commit hook rejects your commit due to formatting issues, simply run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to fix the formatting and then try committing again.
